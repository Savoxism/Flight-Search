# Flight Deals Notification System
This Python project serves to fully automate the process of finding sending the cheapest flight deals to numerous global destinations from Hanoi. (or other cities, depending on the user’s choice). External APIs are needed for this project, namely Sheety and Tequila. Sheety is used to deal with raw input data in Google Sheets while Tequila is used to search for flight offerings based on user’s preferences. The project also integrates other concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), list and dictionary comprehension, and some exceptions handling.
